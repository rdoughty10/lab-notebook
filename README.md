# Ryan Doughty Lab Notebook
This repository contains most of my notes as a PhD student, serving two major purposes:
- A backup of my notes (I have started using obsidian for my lab notebook / notetaking)
- A public location for any of my processes/observations, both for other lab members and the general scientific community

I hope that this is useful both for me and for anybody else
