Starting the new year with a new program for a lab notebook. The github and markdown style of obsidian is really tempting. We will see how it goes, but I think this will be my thing going forward. These daily notes will serve as tasks for the day, overall questions and goals. Each will probably link to more specific project directories, but will serve as a major plan for the day.  This daily notes template will probably also be updated as I continue to use the software.
