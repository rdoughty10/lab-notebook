Starting the new year with a new program for a lab notebook. The github and markdown style of obsidian is really tempting. We will see how it goes, but I think this will be my thing going forward. These daily notes will serve as tasks for the day, overall questions and goals. Each will probably link to more specific project directories, but will serve as a major plan for the day.  This daily notes template will probably also be updated as I continue to use the software. 

# To Do:
- [x] Task 1: Get obsidian up and running and connected to github 
- [ ] Task 2: Make sure classes are all set for the spring semester (do the UTH register form) and calendar is fully setup
	- [ ] Todd's signature
	- [ ] 
- [ ] Task 3: Writing for the Vigo paper
- [ ] (POSTPONED) Task 4: Launch a clustering of UniRef at 80% similarity for seqscreen
- [x] Task 5: Meet with Mike about seqscreen plans
	- [x] Download Seqscreen DB v23.3 on the server
	- [x] Re-run the split-toxins on that DB with the windowed mode (LAUNCHED)
	- [x] Run the k=4 on the split-toxins dataset as well (LAUNCHED)

## Daily Notes

Seqscreen DB successfully downloaded in `/home/dbs/SeqScreenDB_23.3`

Launched jobs (all with windowed mode, 64 threads, seqscreen db 23.3)
p00 --> seqs1
fungcat01 --> seqs2
owlet00 --> seqs3
owlet02 --> seqs4 (note there is not tmux on this server so screen was used)

I also launched a job with k=4 (diamond parameters updated in the nanopore.nf file) on gho with 32 threads:
`./seqscreen --fasta toxin_tests/obfuscation_test_controlled_sequences/all_seqs_no_spaces.fasta --databases ../../../dbs/SeqScreenDB_23.3 --working toxin_tests/all_seqs_ONT/ --threads 32 --ont`
