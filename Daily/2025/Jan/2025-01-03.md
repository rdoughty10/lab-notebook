Friday: Goal is to get as much progress on seqscreen data in the morning, figure out what we need to do depending on results, then work on the introduction for the methods paper.

## To Do:
- [ ] Signatures for UT Health class
- [ ] Seqscreen run output analyses
	- [ ] Compile data from 4 outputs to get statistics
	- [ ] Talk with mike to figure out what to do next
- [ ] Introduction for the methods paper

## Questions
- Q1:
- Q2:

## Daily Notes
Combined output of the 4 runs into `/home/Users/rdd4/seqscreen/toxin_tests/windowed_23.3.csv`

In order to figure out what group each is from, they are labelled in the headers (or from seqscreen output the 'query' column). There are two groups 'intron' and 'notobfuscated' that are different, so have to be processed differently. I did this by identifying that the notobfuscated start with '>sp' vs introns that do not. After all of that the results were:

AflII:247/339=72.86% 	 327/339=96.46%
ApaI:191/273=69.96% 	 250/273=91.58%
BamHI:119/163=73.01% 	 150/163=92.02%
EcoRI:30/54=55.56% 	 49/54=90.74%
EcoRV:0/78=0.0% 	 0/78=0.0%
HindIII:440/581=75.73% 	 552/581=95.01%
KpnI:212/288=73.61% 	 259/288=89.93%
NheI:335/460=72.83% 	 426/460=92.61%
NotI:132/166=79.52% 	 151/166=90.96%
XhoI:213/306=69.61% 	 274/306=89.54%
intron:696/1045=66.6% 	 902/1045=86.32%
notobfuscated:603/1045=57.7% 	 785/1045=75.12%

Not great. The first percentage is if anything is either flagged as cytotoxicity or disable_organ. The second is the first percentage and if the gene matches the intended target. NOTE: EcoRV was accidentally not included, so running that seperately.

FWIW, the results of the ONT run with k=4 are this
AflII:225/339=66.37% 	 280/339=82.6%
ApaI:197/273=72.16% 	 228/273=83.52%
BamHI:133/163=81.6% 	 143/163=87.73%
EcoRI:32/54=59.26% 	 48/54=88.89%
EcoRV:63/78=80.77% 	 70/78=89.74%
HindIII:435/581=74.87% 	 499/581=85.89%
KpnI:210/288=72.92% 	 246/288=85.42%
NheI:314/460=68.26% 	 371/460=80.65%
NotI:133/166=80.12% 	 148/166=89.16%
XhoI:209/306=68.3% 	 242/306=79.08%
intron:705/1045=67.46% 	 846/1045=80.96%
notobfuscated:714/1045=68.33% 	 858/1045=82.11%
